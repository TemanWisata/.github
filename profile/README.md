## üéØ The Big Idea

Every great project starts with a problem. Here's ours:

**The Problem:** In a few sentences, describe the challenge, pain point, or gap you identified. Who is affected by this? Why does it matter? Be specific and relatable. *For example: "Coordinating schedules for university project teams is chaotic. Students waste countless hours in back-and-forth emails, leading to frustration and missed deadlines."*

**Our Solution:** This is your elevator pitch. How does your project solve this problem in a novel or effective way? Highlight the core value proposition. *For example: "We built an intelligent scheduling assistant that syncs with users' calendars, identifies optimal meeting times using a custom algorithm, and facilitates group polling‚Äîall within a single, intuitive dashboard."*

<br>

## ‚ú® Key Features

Here's what our project can do. We focused on creating a seamless user experience through these core functionalities:

*   **ü§ñ Smart Scheduling:** Describe the feature and its benefit. *e.g., "Leverages the Google Calendar API to automatically find and suggest conflict-free meeting slots for all group members."*
*   **üìä Interactive Polling:** *e.g., "Allows users to vote on suggested times, providing a clear and democratic way to finalize a meeting."*
*   **üîî Real-time Notifications:** *e.g., "Integrates with a notification service to keep all members updated on confirmed meetings and changes."*
*   **üìà Project Dashboard:** *e.g., "A centralized view of all upcoming deadlines, meetings, and project milestones."*
