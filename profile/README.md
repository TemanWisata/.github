## üéØ The Big Idea

Every great project starts with a problem. Here's ours:

**The Problem:** The modern traveler faces a paradox of choice‚Äîan overwhelming amount of information when planning a trip. Sifting through countless blogs, reviews, and travel sites is time-consuming and often leads to visiting the same popular, overcrowded places. This "information overload" can diminish the travel experience and prevents tourists from discovering hidden gems that match their unique interests.

**Our Solution:** "Teman Wisata" (meaning "Travel Buddy") is a recommender system designed to solve this problem for tourism in Indonesia. By leveraging machine learning, our platform provides highly individualized travel recommendations. We analyze user preferences and interactions to suggest attractions across five major Indonesian cities: Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Bandung, and Surabaya. Our goal is to simplify trip planning, enhance the traveler's journey, and promote a diverse range of local attractions.

<br>

## ‚ú® Key Features

Here's what our project can do. We focused on creating a seamless user experience through these core functionalities:


- **üéØ Personalized Recommendations:** After rating a few destinations, the system uses collaborative and content-based filtering to generate a personalized list of similar locations that are likely to appeal to the user.

- **üìç Rate Destinations:** Users can rate tourist attractions, which helps the system learn their preferences and improve the quality of future recommendations.
- **üèÜ Discover Top Places:** See a curated list of the top-rated destinations and popular attractions by province to get inspiration for your next trip.
- **‚ö° Fast & Responsive:** Implemented caching for the recommendation models to ensure users receive suggestions quickly and efficiently.
- **üîê Secure Authentication:** A complete authentication system allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their own interaction data securely.

#### Architecture Overview:

Our system is designed as a microservices architecture, containerized and orchestrated with Kubernetes (K3s). The infrastructure is deployed on a single VM, prioritizing resource efficiency while maintaining full compatibility and scalability.

- **Frontend:** Built with **TypeScript, Alpine.js, Vite, Handlebars, Tailwind, and DaisyUI** for a responsive, fast, and efficient user interface.
- **Backend:** A high-performance RESTful API powered by **FastAPI** (Python), handling all business logic, data processing, and interactions with the ML models.
- **Database & Cache:** We use **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) as our primary database for relational data and **Redis** for high-speed caching of frequent queries and recommendation results.
- **Machine Learning:** Models are trained using the **RecTools** library. The entire ML lifecycle, including experiment tracking and model storage, is managed with **MLflow** and **MinIO**.
- **Deployment & Orchestration:** The application is containerized with **Containerd** and deployed on a lightweight **K3s** Kubernetes cluster running on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**. Networking is managed by **Flannel** and exposed securely via **NGINX Ingress Controller** and **Cloudflare**.
- **Observability:** A comprehensive monitoring and logging stack is implemented using **Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Promtail** to provide deep insights into system health, metrics, and logs.

## üîÆ What's Next?

We're proud of what we've built, but we're not done yet! Here are some features and improvements we're planning for the future:

- [ ] **Enable Autoscaling:** Adopt autoscaling with HPA or KEDA to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic load.
- [ ] **Expand to a Multi-Node HA Cluster:** Migrate from a single-node VM to a high-availability cluster to improve fault tolerance and scalability.
- [ ] **Implement a CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the build, test, and deployment process to streamline development and ensure code quality.
- [ ] **Enable Distributed MinIO:** Configure MinIO in a distributed mode for more resilient and scalable object storage.
- [ ] **Add Distributed Tracing:** Integrate Tempo or Jaeger to get a comprehensive view of requests as they travel through our microservices.
- [ ] **Introduce a Service Mesh:** Implement a service mesh like Kiali to enhance observability, traffic management, and security between services.
